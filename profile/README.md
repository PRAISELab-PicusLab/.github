## 🧠 About Us

The **PRAISE (PRedictive AnalytIcs for underStanding big multimEdia data)** research group is part of the **PICUS Lab** at the **Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies (DIETI)**, University of Naples Federico II, Italy.  
We are a team of researchers with a strong background in **AI**, **multimodal data understanding**, and **predictive analytics** across multiple domains including **eHealth**, **Social Network Analysis**, and **Multimedia Data Analysis**.

Our goal is to develop intelligent systems that can **understand**, **predict**, and **interact** with complex multimedia information—especially focusing on language, vision, and their integration.
